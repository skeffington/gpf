- at least 1 anchor is required for a peptide to be found
  - tryptic cleavage sites act as anchors
    - tryptic anchors could be optionally disabled with a higher tag size
      (in this case, we would also find non-tryptic peptides, but slower)
      OR CAN THEY? Maybe not, ponder this.
  - scaffold start/end also acts as anchor
  - stop codons?
- resulting mass has to be correct within relative mass accuracy (ppm)
- for intron split peptides, splice donor/acceptor consensus sequences 
  must be correct


differences to last version of GPF:

- only one tryptic cleavage site is required (instead of two),
  i. e. semitryptic peptides can be found
- HMST size can be freely adjusted in the indexing step (fixed at 3 
  before)
- splice donor/acceptor site consensus sequences can be freely chosen 
  during the search
- for intron split peptides, a correctly predicted HMST is required for
  one exon only (instead of one correct HMST in every exon)
- big genomic sequences can be indexed with a minimum amount of RAM 
  (which can be increased to speed up the indexing)
