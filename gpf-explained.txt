- at least 1 anchor is required for a peptide to be found
  - tryptic cleavage sites act as anchors
    - tryptic anchors could be optionally disabled with a higher tag size
      (in this case, we would also find non-tryptic peptides, but slower)
      OR CAN THEY? Maybe not, ponder this.
  - scaffold start/end also acts as anchor
  - stop codons also act as anchors
- resulting mass has to be correct within relative mass accuracy (ppm)
- for intron split peptides, splice donor/acceptor consensus sequences 
  must be correct


differences to previous version of GPF:

- tag size can be freely adjusted in the indexing step (fixed at 3 
  before)
- only one tryptic cleavage site (or protein start/end/stop codon site)
  is required (instead of two), i. e. semitryptic peptides can be found
- missed cleavages are not an issue anymore, an unlimited number of
  missed cleavages is allowed
- splice donor/acceptor site consensus sequences can be freely chosen 
- for intron split peptides, a correctly predicted HMST is required for
  one exon only (instead of one correct HMST in every exon)
- big genomic sequences can be indexed with a minimum amount of RAM 
  (which can be increased to speed up the indexing)
  
GNO rules:

+ or - denote the DNA reading direction
offset:length pairs always reflect the first nucleotide and the length
  of the alignment, always in respect to the amino acid sequence

Search Parameters
-----------------

Similarity search: yes* / no
Distinguish I/L: yes / no*
Search immediate alignments: yes* / no
Search intron-split alignments: yes / no / conditional*
Max intron length: 2100
Splice donor/acceptor site consensus sequences: GT|AG,GC|AG
Mass accuracy: 5 ppm
Intron search type: quick / intensive*
  - quick: require a tag in every exon, finds less alignments,
    but will find all correctly predicted immediate hits plus
    all correctly predicted intron-split hits that are fully
    tryptic and have a complete tag in every exon
  - intensive: require only one tag, finds most alignments
